# Intro
This is the %ZIS code from VISTA annotated so I can understand it better.
# Overall flow
To open the device, use ^%ZIS.

Documentation on %ZIS can be found in the Kernel Manual.

%ZIS -> %ZIS1 -> %ZIS2 -> %ZIS3 -> %ZIS6 -> O^%ZIS4 -> %ZIS6 -> MARGN, SETPAR^%ZIS3

To close the device use ^%ZISC. Only that routine does that.
